# QPSK-Modulator

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is a modulation technique used in digital communication systems to transmit data by changing the phase of a carrier signal. It operates by encoding two bits of data into four distinct phase shifts: 0째, 90째, 180째, and 270째. Each phase shift corresponds to a unique pair of bits, enabling QPSK to transmit twice the amount of data per symbol compared to Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK). The QPSK modulator splits the input bitstream into two separate bitstreams, which modulate two orthogonal carriers (usually sine and cosine waves) that are then combined to form the QPSK signal. At the receiver, the QPSK demodulator separates the combined signal back into its orthogonal components, decodes the phase shifts, and converts them back into the original bit pairs. This modulation scheme is efficient in terms of bandwidth utilization and is robust against noise, making it suitable for various communication applications, including satellite and cellular networks. The use of differential encoding can enhance its performance by simplifying phase ambiguity resolution during the demodulation process.
